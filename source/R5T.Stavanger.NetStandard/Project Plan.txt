R5T.Stavanger.NetStandard - A NetStandard-based IShortcutOperator service implementation for the Stavanger project.

Goals

Create an IShortcutOperator implementation that does NOT take a COM reference, and so can thus be a .NET Standard library.

The actual functionality is done via platform-invoke (or its COM equivalent).
